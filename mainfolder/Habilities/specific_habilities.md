# My specific habilities

I know this languages: 
* Programing: Python, Javascript, PHP, Bash, Batch, Java and Typescript.
* Of query: SQL, XPATH
* Markup: HTML, XML, Markdown
* XML-related: XSD, XSLT
* Of templates: Liquid.

My favorite is Python, because there are a lot of libraries, it's practical, and very complete, you can do a lot of things with it.
