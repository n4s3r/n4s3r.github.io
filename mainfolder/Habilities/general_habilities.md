# My general habilities

### Languages
I can speak **_spanish_**, **_catalan_** and **_english_**. I usually speak _spanish_, but my _catalan_ and _english_ is fluent too. When I was studying [SMX](https://agora.xtec.cat/ies-estatut/estudis-2/cicles-formatius/sistemes-microinformatics-i-xarxes-smx/), at the same time I was studying english at [Hello international school](https://www.hellointernationalschool.com/).

### Licences
I have the **_car driving license_**.

### Working general habilities
In my live as a student and as a worker, I developed certain habilities and values to obtain the objetives.

I think the most important is **_hardworking_**. Because in the live or even the rutine of a student and a worker, there are a lot of situations that it's needed the deep research of a good solution. And I love IT, specially cibersecurity, and it's not a problem for me to spent a lot of energy and time to solve some problem.

One of the most important too is the capability of **_working in groups_**, because it's the tendency because is a better way to work, because each member of the group can specialize of a part or task of the project, and be better. I allways loved sports, specially by teams, like handball, football, volleyball, and other, and I think this made me better in group dynamics. I think it's very important because doing activities by teams, the members develop habilities by _roles_ and also other habilities like _strategy and response_. In my student live, I developed activities in different roles, like leader, spokesman and evaluator. I know that inside of this categories, there are a lot of subcategories, and I think depending the project and the situation, this is variable, and I can change roll, there's no problem.

For _working in groups_ it's very important to have **_self-criticism_** and **_good mood_** to have a good atmosphere. When I was working in [electrans](https://www.electrans.es/), I really saw it, there was a nice atmosphere, and it was more pleasant to work in it, and I tried to contribute to that.

And of course is very important to have **_discipline_** to be _constant_ at work and study. I don't have problems with _discipline_, because I love what I'm dedicating myself to.
