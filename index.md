# Welcome dear user
### Thank you for visiting my webpage

You can call me Naser, but it's not my real name, it's only a nickname that I've chosen because I thought it sound good. 
I'm 21 years old, and since I was a kid, I wanted to work in cybersecurity.

Specially I like red team, and inside the red team I love pentesting, but I like all cybersecurity rolls. I like to spent a lot of time on acquiring new knowledge about cybersecurity, and more in the times we live in, because all is changing very fast.

In the menu you can find more information about me, but if you want more, please, contact me:
